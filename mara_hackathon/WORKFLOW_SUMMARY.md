# ‚ö°Ô∏è Energy-Bitcoin Mining Optimization Workflow

## üèóÔ∏è Complete Agentic System Architecture

We have successfully integrated **6 specialized agents** into a comprehensive Bitcoin mining optimization system that dynamically responds to hardware improvements and carbon credit opportunities.

## üîÑ Workflow Execution Order

### **Phase 1: Data Gathering (Parallel Execution)**
1. **Market Intelligence Agent** - Fetches real-time LMP data across all ISOs
2. **Hardware Scout Agent** - Scans for new mining hardware with better efficiency
3. **Environmental Analyst** - Calculates carbon intensity for each power grid

### **Phase 2: Strategic Optimization (Sequential)**
4. **Optimization Strategist** - Uses market data, carbon data, AND hardware recommendations to calculate optimal mining strategies
5. **Carbon Arbitrageur** - Analyzes final recommendations for carbon credit opportunities

### **Phase 3: Publication**
6. **Dashboard Publisher** - Formats and publishes all insights including hardware and carbon recommendations

## üéØ Key Innovations

### **Hardware Scout Agent**
- **Fake Data Sources**: Bitmain, MicroBT, Canaan announcements
- **Intelligence**: Identifies miners with ‚â•5% efficiency improvements
- **Impact**: Updates global MINER_WTH value for all subsequent calculations
- **Output**: JSON with update recommendation and new efficiency baseline

```json
{
  "update": "yes",
  "report": "WhatsMiner M56S++ achieves 22 J/TH (78% improvement)",
  "MINER_WTH": 22.0,
  "efficiency_improvement_percent": 78.0
}
```

### **Carbon Arbitrageur Agent**
- **Fake Data Sources**: 45Q tax credits, California ARB, EU ETS prices
- **Intelligence**: Calculates if carbon credits change mining location economics
- **Impact**: Can override pure profit optimization for ESG benefits
- **Output**: Advisory paragraph + carbon_events tracking

```python
carbon_events = [
  ("2025-06-21T03:21:16Z", "45Q Tax Credit Increased to $85/tCO2", 0.026),
  ("2025-06-20T15:21:16Z", "California Carbon Allowances Hit Record $41.50/tCO2", 0.013),
]
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Dynamic Efficiency Updates**
- `calculate_profit_per_carbon_intensity()` now accepts `custom_miner_wth` parameter
- Hardware Scout recommendations automatically propagate through optimization calculations
- All profit metrics reflect latest hardware efficiency improvements

### **Integrated Decision Making**
- Optimization Strategist receives context from Hardware Scout
- Carbon Arbitrageur analyzes final optimization results
- Dashboard Publisher synthesizes all agent outputs

### **Realistic Fake Data**
- **Hardware News**: Mix of relevant (new miners) and irrelevant (market news) items
- **Carbon Markets**: Real policy references (45Q, EU ETS) with simulated price movements
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Realistic 5-78% efficiency gains from actual manufacturer specs

## üìä Example Workflow Results

### **Without Hardware Upgrade** (100 W/TH baseline):
- CAISO: $0.0296/kgCO2 (best profit/carbon ratio)
- Recommendation: Mine in CAISO at negative pricing locations

### **With Hardware Scout Upgrade** (22 W/TH - 78% improvement):
- Hardware savings: $34.16/TH/year in electricity costs
- Updated profit calculations with new efficiency
- Carbon footprint further reduced due to lower power consumption

### **With Carbon Arbitrageur Analysis**:
- California carbon credits: +$41.50/tCO2 for CAISO mining
- Moving 1000 TH/s from MISO‚ÜíCAISO: $2.80/year additional revenue
- ESG score improvement quantified

## üéÆ Running the System

### **Individual Agent Testing**:
```bash
# Test hardware scout and carbon arbitrageur with fake data
python test_new_agents.py

# Test complete workflow simulation
python test_full_workflow.py
```

### **Full CrewAI System**:
```bash
# Run all 6 agents in proper sequence
uv tool run crewai run

# Continuous monitoring
python src/mara_hackathon/main.py continuous
```

## üìà Business Impact

### **Multi-Dimensional Optimization**:
1. **Profit**: Negative pricing arbitrage + hardware efficiency gains
2. **Environment**: Lowest carbon intensity regions + carbon credit revenue
3. **Operations**: Dynamic hardware upgrade recommendations
4. **ESG**: Quantified environmental impact improvements

### **Real-Time Adaptability**:
- Hardware Scout prevents obsolete efficiency assumptions
- Carbon Arbitrageur captures policy-driven revenue opportunities
- Combined system maximizes both profit AND environmental performance

## üèÜ Achievements
