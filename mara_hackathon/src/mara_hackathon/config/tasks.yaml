# Phase 1: Independent data gathering tasks (run in parallel)
hardware_scout_task:
  description: >
    Scan the latest Bitcoin mining hardware announcements, specifications, and vendor releases
    to identify any new ASIC miners that offer better energy efficiency than the current
    {miner_efficiency} W/TH standard. Focus on reputable manufacturers like Bitmain, MicroBT,
    Canaan, and analyze their latest models for potential efficiency gains.
  expected_output: >
    A JSON report following this exact schema:
    {
      "update": "<yes|no>",
      "report": "<short persuasive paragraph explaining the model, sources and % power saving>",
      "MINER_WTH": <float>,
      "efficiency_improvement_percent": <float>
    }
  agent: hardware_scout

market_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze real-time energy markets across all ISOs to identify the most economical locations
    for Bitcoin mining. Fetch current LMP (Locational Marginal Pricing) data, Bitcoin hashprice,
    and calculate basic profitability metrics for each region.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive market analysis containing:
    - Current LMP prices for all ISOs with averages and ranges
    - Bitcoin price and hashprice metrics
    - Initial profitability calculations per region
    - Identification of negative pricing opportunities
  agent: market_intelligence_agent

carbon_assessment_task:
  description: >
    Evaluate the carbon intensity of each ISO's power grid based on current fuel mix.
    Calculate the carbon footprint per MWh for each region and identify the cleanest
    energy sources currently available.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed environmental assessment including:
    - Carbon intensity (gCO2/MWh) for each ISO
    - Current fuel mix breakdown by region
    - Ranking of regions by clean energy percentage
    - Environmental risk factors and ESG considerations
  agent: environmental_analyst

# Phase 2: Strategic optimization (uses results from Phase 1)
optimization_decision_task:
  description: >
    Synthesize market and environmental data to determine optimal mining strategies.
    Calculate profit per carbon ratios for each region and recommend specific actions
    including location selection, mining intensity, and timing. Use the hardware scout's findings
    to incorporate any efficiency improvements into profitability calculations.
  expected_output: >
    Strategic recommendations containing:
    - Ranked list of regions by profit/carbon efficiency
    - Specific mining location recommendations
    - Suggested mining intensity levels (0-100%)
    - Hardware efficiency considerations and updated calculations if applicable

    - hardware_scout_task
    - market_analysis_task
    - carbon_assessment_task

# Phase 3: Carbon arbitrage analysis (uses optimization results)
carbon_arbitrage_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the latest carbon credit market prices and policy developments to determine if
    mining in cleaner regions could generate additional revenue through carbon credits or
    regulatory incentives. Review the optimization strategy results and assess whether
    reallocating hashrate to lower-carbon regions would improve overall profitability
    when carbon credits are factored in.
  expected_output: >
    A concise advisory paragraph (â‰¤120 words) recommending any carbon-credit driven
    strategy adjustments, followed by a list of carbon_events tracking notable
    market developments and their projected revenue impact.

    - carbon_assessment_task
    - hardware_scout_task

# Phase 4: Dashboard publication (uses all results)
dashboard_update_task:
  description: >
    Format and publish all insights to the monitoring dashboard. Create clear visualizations
    of profit/carbon ratios, generate alerts for exceptional opportunities (like negative pricing),
    and update all relevant metrics. Include hardware upgrade recommendations and carbon
    credit opportunities.
  expected_output: >
    Dashboard update package including:
    - Formatted JSON data for API endpoints
    - Alert notifications for significant events
    - Executive summary of current mining status
    - Visual representation of profit/carbon rankings
    - Hardware upgrade recommendations if applicable
    - Carbon credit arbitrage opportunities
  agent: dashboard_publisher
